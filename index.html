    <h3>LUCKY</h3>
    <img src="img/lucky.jpg">
    <p>Lucky (ラッキー, Rakkī?, Lucky) is a lazy dog villager from the Animal Crossing series. He has appeared in every game to date. His name comes from the fact that he has a full body cast and is still alive, making him "lucky". It could also be perceived as ironic, seeing that Lucky is not very lucky at all due to possibly being badly injured or undead.</p>

    <h3>KIKI</h3>
    <img src="img/kiki.jpg">
    <p>Kiki (キャビア, Kyabia?, Caviar) is a normal cat villager which has appeared in every Animal Crossing series game. Her name may come from Hayao Miyazaki's Kiki's Delivery Service, an anime film about a young witch-in-training named Kiki who has a black cat, named Jiji.</p>
