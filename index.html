    <h3>LUCKY</h3>
    <img src="img/lucky.jpg">
    <p>Lucky (ラッキー, Rakkī?, Lucky) is a lazy dog villager from the Animal Crossing series. He has appeared in every game to date. His name comes from the fact that he has a full body cast and is still alive, making him "lucky". It could also be perceived as ironic, seeing that Lucky is not very lucky at all due to possibly being badly injured or undead.</p>
